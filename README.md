Let's try RAG from Scratch with langchain!

First, let's create a basic virtualenv.

```
azhr@tomahawk:~/Code/rag$ python3 -m venv env
azhr@tomahawk:~/Code/rag$ source env/bin/activate
```

Now we can install jupyter to run some notebooks.

```
pip install jupyter
```

And run it:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Now we're ready to try to proceed with part1:
